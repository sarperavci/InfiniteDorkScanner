## What is Infinite Dork Scanner?

IDS is a premium OSINT tool that allows you to scan dorks on Search Engines **WITHOUT LIMITS**. Forget about IP blocking, rate limiting and other restrictions. IDS is the best OSINT tool for scanning dorks and finding interesting URLs!

**IDS guarantees to retrieve URLs that have parameters that are possibly vulnerable to:**

- SQL Injection
- XSS

## Project Status

We need some time to finish the tool. We are working hard to make it the best OSINT tool on the market.

For now, you can use our free version of the tool. It has some limitations but it's still a great tool!

In the data folder, we have **500000** pre-scanned URLs that you can use for free. The demo IDS reads the data and outputs the URLs to a file.
